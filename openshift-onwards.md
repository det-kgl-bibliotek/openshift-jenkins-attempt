Created a standalone jenkins

Created a github token, see secrets.md

In jenkins, register this as a user/password credential, with username blekinge

Create det-kgl-bibliotek github org in jenkins
configure it to use the credentials

it scans the github org and finds nothing worthy



We do NOT use different projects, we use one project per github org

We use labels instead
